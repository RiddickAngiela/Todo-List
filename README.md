# To-Do List Application

This is a simple to-do list application built using ReactJS. The application allows users to add new to-do items, mark them as complete, and delete them. The list of to-do items is persistently stored in the browser's local storage, so it remains available even after the application is closed and reopened.

## Features

- Add new to-do items with a title and timestamp.
- Mark to-do items as complete or incomplete.
- Delete to-do items.
- View all to-do items with completed items visually distinct from incomplete items.
- Persistent storage using local storage.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
cd todo-app
run npm start.
